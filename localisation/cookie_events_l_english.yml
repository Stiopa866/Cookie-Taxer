 cookies.1.t: "Cookie Factory Explodes"
 cookies.1.d: "My great cookie master! A tragedy has hit our country. One of our cookie industrial complexes has exploded. Many think that it was due to incompetence in the working force in there, however some more radical cookie enjoyers blame ]neighbor_country.GetName], thinking that they're trying to stop our rightful cause in acquiring all the cookies in the world."
 cookies.1.a: "What a tragedy!"

 cookies.2.a: "That's a lot of cookies we're talking about...."
 cookies.2.b: "Dear God, no."
 
 cookies.3.t: "The Evil Cookie Merchant"
 cookies.3.d: "Although the cookie economy has been prospering, one of the greatest grandmas making them has fallen ill. A slimy merchant however has the cure for that.

 cookies.4.t: "Mana? In my Cookie Factory?"
 cookies.4.d: "One of the workers in the cookie factories has reported to you an issue. As he was sitting there, minding his own business, producing even more cookies, the strangest thing has happened. Instead of the delicious cookies, a bird, a piece of paper, and 2 crossed swords came out of the machine. He remarked it as 'queer' and decided to report this directly to you. What will you do about this issue?"

 cookies.7.d: "My liege. Reports have reached you that some mages have been performing metal magic on some of your cookies, turning them into iron. The economy has not been the same since, as much of your cookie supplies are now gone. Quite.....paradoxical."

 cookies.8.t: "Cookie Gambling"

 cookies.9.t: "Emperor Coo Ke the Wise"
 cookies.9.d: "Did you ever hear the tragedy of Emperor Coo Ke the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Romans would tell you. It's a Gothic legend. Emperor Coo Ke was a Warlord of the Goths, so powerful and so wise he could use the labor to influence the factories to create cookies... He had such a knowledge of the sliders that he could even keep the people from hunting accidents. The sliders is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his heir everything he knew, then his heir sent him hunting. It's ironic he could save others from hunting accidents, but not himself."

 cookies.11.b: "Perhaps violence is not the way."
 
 cookies.12.t: "The Cookie Scbism"
 cookies.12.d: "Although many think that we should be united in the cookie production, many debate as to how cookies should be made. Some argue that the orthodox ways of circular cookies is the best.

 cookies.15.t: "Welcome to Cookie Taxer"
 cookies.15.d: "Cookie Taxer adds idle game mechanics to EU4, which integrate into the gameplay loop you know and love. In this mod, you collect ever-increasing numbers of cookies. You can invest these into making your nation stronger, but as all idle game players know, the big number is a goal in and of itself.\n\nTo start, open the economy tab, and click on the big cookie. Now, you have 1 cookie! Once you've collected 15 this way, you can build your very first building, the §YCursor§!. In the buildings view, in the province or macrobuilder, you will see a new set of buildings you can build. These do not generate a single cookie like your click does, but instead, passively generate cookies each month.\n\nThe economy tab also lists a series of upgrades. These start out at 1000 £cookie£ each but scale rapidly each time you buy one. You can have up to 128 upgrades of each type.\n\nScattered randomly across Europe are a set of province modifiers. These significantly buff cookie production, either for individual buildings, or globally! Plan your expansion with these in mind, as they are the best way to scale up your cookie production."
 cookies.15.a: "Now I am become idle, the Taxer of Cookies."
